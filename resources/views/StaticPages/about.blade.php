                <p class="leading-normal text-grey-darker font-medium mb-3">I was raised just outside of Huntington, WV, with the
                    Ohio River in my back yard. I grew up on a beef cattle farm, but spent every free minute fishing in
                    the river. After college (BS Marketing) I went to work, but I couldn’t get fishing out of my head.
                    My wife and I moved to western Kentucky, where I spent many years fishing bass tournaments. In 2010
                    we moved to Port St Joe and in 2012 I became a licensed Captain, and full-time fishing guide. At the
                    age of 54, I had finally found my perfect career.</p>

                <p class="leading-normal text-grey-darker font-medium mb-3">I’ve now logged over a thousand trips including family
                    outings, where a child catches his first big redfish, or speckled sea trout, or even a shark! Many
                    trips include three generations with a grandfather taking his son and grandchildren out for some
                    adventure. And, of course don’t forget the buddy trips, where old friends catch up while catching
                    dinner!</p>

                <p class="leading-normal text-grey-darker font-medium mb-3">I fish out of a 2008 23-foot Ranger bay boat powered by
                    a 2017 Suzuki 300. It is equipped with Garmin GPS, and fishfinder, Hydrowave fish attractor,
                    powerpole, and 36-volt Minn Kota Ulterra trolling motor, as well as all Coast Guard required safety
                    equipment.</p>
