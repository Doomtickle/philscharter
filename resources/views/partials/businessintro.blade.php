            <p class="text-sm text-grey py-4">Welcome to Phil’s Charter Service. With over 1,000 successful trips on
                St. Joseph Bay and surrounding waters, I feel
                confident I can provide you and your family and friends, a safe, enjoyable trip you’ll remember for
                a lifetime. The
                variety of fish we catch in St Joe Bay is amazing, including speckled sea trout, red drum, black
                drum, flounder,
                sheepshead, Spanish mackerel, pompano, shark and many others. </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-grey">I provide the experience, equipment, bait and license. All you need to
                bring is sunscreen, snacks, and drinks.
                I’ll even clean your fish, if you want to take home dinner!</p>
